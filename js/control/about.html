		<p>Civic Graph is a crowdsourced knowledge graph that maps people & organizations doing work in civic tech across all six inhabited continents.
			We define 'civic tech' as the use of technology for the public good. Civic Graph has two main use cases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To familiarize yourself with the civic tech space.</li>
			<li>To use the tool as a means for a particular end (collaborations, funding, data exchanges, etc.)</li>
		</ol>
			<p>It is an educational tool, an open information platform, and a resource for network transparency.
			Civic Graph is an open source project by Microsoft licensed under a CC BY-SA 4.0. Take a look at the source code <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE">here.</a></p>
